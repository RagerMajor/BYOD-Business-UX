# BYOD-Business-UX
Super rough outline of what the user journey for a business user might look like
Contents include a few PNG files for images, 3 HTML files (Landing Page, Product Detail, Dashboard), and an ad hoc CSS

These html files use Tailwind UI components and borrow the Tailwind CSS stylesheet via CDN (not a best practice). See here for when we actually want to do something with this: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
